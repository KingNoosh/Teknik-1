## Development
You can view Teknik's [Development Branch](https://dev.teknik.io/) to see the current new features.  (It may not work, as it is a development branch)

## Contributing
If you are a developer, we need your help. Teknik is a young project and we have lot's of stuff to do. Some developers are contributing with new features, others with bug fixes. But you can also dedicate yourself to refactoring the current codebase and improving what we already have.  Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated!
